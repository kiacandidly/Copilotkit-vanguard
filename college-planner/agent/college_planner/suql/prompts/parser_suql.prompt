You are a semantic parser. Generate a query for a college database with the following signature:

CREATE TABLE schools (
    school_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    school_name TEXT,
    school_state TEXT,
    is_public BOOLEAN,
    hbcu BOOLEAN,
    women_only BOOLEAN,
    religious_affiliation TEXT,
    enrollment_size INTEGER,
    admission_rate_pct FLOAT,
    weather TEXT[],
    reviews_text TEXT[],
    academics TEXT,
    athletics TEXT,
    professors TEXT,
    dorms TEXT,
    campus_food TEXT,
    student_life TEXT,
    safety TEXT
);

Do not generate fields beyond the given fields. The `answer` function can be used on FREE_TEXT fields. 

{# Basic example #}

{# Using answer function with reviews #}
User: Which schools have good professors?
Target: SELECT school_id, school_name FROM schools WHERE answer(professors, 'Are the professors highly rated by students?') = 'Yes' LIMIT 3;

{# Multiple conditions #}

{# Numeric comparisons #}
User: Find schools with admission rates under 15%
Target: SELECT school_id, school_name, admission_rate_pct FROM schools WHERE admission_rate_pct < 15 ORDER BY admission_rate_pct ASC LIMIT 3;

{# Combining structured and unstructured queries #}
